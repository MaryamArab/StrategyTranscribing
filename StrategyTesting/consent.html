    <h2>STUDY ON EXPERT PROGRAMMING STRATEGIES</h2>
    <h2> TESTERS INFORMED CONSENT FORM</h2>
    <h3> RESEARCH PROCEDURES</h3>
    <p>This research is being conducted to better understand the difficulties and challenges expert developers have in writing their strategies in a sequence of steps that can
        be followed by other developers as a guidance reference to follow and finish a programming task successfully. Helping to
        reduce the possible difficulties in articulating strategies will bring us the hope of having a pool of strategies for every programming tasks in future.</p>
    <p>If you agree to participate, we will first ask you a few questions about your experience in front-end web development. You will then be asked to read two
        programming strategies and try them out by working on two related programming tasks. After using the strategies, we will ask you for your feedback and comments on
        the strategies, which we will provide to the authors of each strategy to help them improve it. If we have questions about your comments or feedback, we may contact you
        by email to ask for additional details.
        We expect the study to last approximately 60 minutes in total which you are free to complete anytime at your convenience during a two-day period.</p>

    <h3> RISKS</h3>
    <p>There are no foreseeable risks for participating in this research beyond those experienced in everyday work.</p>

    <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
    <p>Participating in this study will offer you the opportunity to learn two expert programming strategies and have the potential to improve your programming skills. By giving feedback to the authors of the programming strategy,
        you will help them in writing strategies which more effectively support programming work.</p>

    <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
    <p>The data in this study will be confidential. To maintain the confidentiality of your data, you will be assigned a unique participant ID. All of your data will be associated with your participant ID and not your identity.
        Only members of research team will have access to the identification key linking your identity to your data. </p>
    <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
    <p>You must be 18 years of age or older, be able to program in JavaScript, and be familiar with front-end web development. </p>
    <p>Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If you decide not to participate, or if you withdraw from the study, there is no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. There are no costs or any other penalty to you.</p>
    <p>You will receive a $30 Amazon gift card for your complete participation in the study. The gift card will be given to you after you finished your assigned tasks. If you withdraw from the study, you will not be compensated partially.</p>
