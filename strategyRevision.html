    <legend>Please review your strategy, stepping through it line by line and make sure your strategy is clear and a novice would understand it.
        <p>In order to better understand the missing point in your strategy you can test it with the following sample of programming task.
            Think and read aloud each step and for each, try to apply the strategy to the following programming task.</p>
        <P>Please feel free to add corrections or details as you review your strategy</P>
