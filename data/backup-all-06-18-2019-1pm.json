Apple provides an MTKView as a solution for easily rendering\n#Metal backed content to a view. This Strategy helps you to use CoreImage to render to a MTKView on iOS.\n\n#Required Tools and Environment\n- Assuming XCode is already installed on the system, project is checked out,\nand successfully building/running.\n- Assuming a Metal backed image processing pipeline has already been set up \nin the project\n\n#Required Knowledge\n- basic knowlege of Metal and CoreImage on iOS\n- experience with Swift or Objective-C \n\nSTRATEGY useCoreImageToRenderToMetalView()\n    #create a CoreImage Context using the Metal device\n    Find where the Metal device is being created in the project\n    IF a CoreImage Context has not already been created\n        Immediately after creating the metal device, create a CoreImage Context, passing the device in as the parameter\n    #verify the MTKView is framebufferOnly propety configured properly\n    IF the MTKView's framebufferOnly property is not set OR the MTKViews framebufferOnly property == TRUE\n        #this is a very important step as it allows a CIImage to be written directly \n        #to the MTKView's texture. Otherwise, the output will display a solid purple/pink color.\n        set the MTKView's framebufferOnly property to FALSE\n    #A new command buffer will be created on each render pass \n    Create a new command buffer using the Metal device's command queue\n    Create a new CIImage from the given pixel buffer you would like to render\n    #apply whatever CIFilters you would like to use on the CIImage (one after another)\n    FOR EACH 'filter' IN 'CIFilters'\n        DO applyFilter(CIImage)\n    #after the filters have been applied to the CIImage, render the CIImage to the MTKView\n    Use the CoreImage Context created earlier to render the CIImage directly to the MTKView's current drawable\n    #submit the command buffer to be executed by the GPU\n    Present the command buffer \n    Commit the commmand buffer\n    RETURN nothing\n    ",
