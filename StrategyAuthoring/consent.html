    <h2>STUDY ON EXPERT PROGRAMMING STRATEGIES</h2>
    <h2> INFORMED CONSENT FORM</h2>
    <h3> RESEARCH PROCEDURES</h3>
    <p>This research is being conducted to better understand the difficulties and challenges expert developers have in writing their strategies in a sequence of steps that can be followed by other
        developers as a guidance reference to follow and finish a programming task successfully. Helping to reduce the possible difficulties in articulating strategies will bring us the hope of having
        a pool of strategies for every programming tasks in future.</p>
    <p>If you agree to participate, you will first be asked to read a tutorial explaining programming strategies and how to write them in a way other developer can use.
        You will then be asked to share one of your own programming strategies as well as some background about your own experience in front-end web development.
        Next, we will send your strategy to two or more developers, who will try out using your strategy on a real programming task. After using your strategy, they will prepare some comments and feedback
        on their experiences using your strategy. In the second phase of the study, we will send you the comments and feedback on your strategy. You’ll then have an opportunity to improve your
        strategy and answer a few questions about your experiences. We expect the first study phase to take approximately 45 minutes and the second study phase to take approximately 30 minutes.
        You will be given a 4 days period for completing the first phase and a 4 days period for the second phase.</p>

    <h3> RISKS</h3>
    <p>There are no foreseeable risks for participating in this research beyond those experienced in everyday work.</p>

    <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
    <p>By sharing your one of your own programming strategies, you will have the opportunity to help other developers learn from your expertise.
        Beyond having an additional opportunity to practice programming strategies,
        there are no direct benefits to you for participating other than to assist with the research. </p>

    <h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
    <p>The data in this study will be confidential. To maintain the confidentiality of your data, you will be assigned a unique participant ID.
        All your data will be associated with your participant ID and not your identity. Only members of research team will have access to the identification
        key linking your identity to your data. While it is understood that no computer transmission can be perfectly secure, reasonable efforts will be made
        to protect the confidentiality of your transmission. The de-identified data could be used for future research without additional consent from participants.</p>

    <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
    <p>You must be 18 years of age or older, be a developer with at least 3 years of experience in front-end web development to participate in this study. </p>
    <p>Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If you decide not to participate, or if you withdraw from the study, there is no penalty or
        loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. There are no costs or any other penalty to you.</p>
    <p>You will receive a $40 Amazon gift card for your complete participation in the study. The gift card will be given to you after you finished your assigned tasks. If you withdraw from the study before completing both phases, you will not be compensated partially.</p>
