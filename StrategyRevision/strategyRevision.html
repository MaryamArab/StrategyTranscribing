                <p> Welcome to the Explicit Programming Strategies study revision phase.</p>
                <p>We asked a few developers to try the strategy you wrote on a
                    <a id="programmingTaskAnchor">Programming Task.</a>
                    Based on their experiences, they wrote comments for you about what they found to be confusing or hard to use.
                    For each of their comments, we’d like to know if the comment is helpful for you in improving your strategy.
                    Please let us know what, if anything, is difficult in applying their comments to your strategy.
                </p>

            <h3>Feedback from Developers on Your Strategy</h3>
            <p>The following comments are the feedbacks 2 testers wrote about your strategy after they tested it. We asked 5 questions from each tester. Each question, therefore, has 2 comments from 2 different testers:</p>
            <h3>Question 1:What made it challenging to work with the strategy? </h3>
            <div id="challengingToWork" ></div>

            <div id="missing" ></div>
            <h3>Question 3: What additional information, details, or features would make it easier for you to follow this strategy?</h3>
            <div id="requiredInfo" ></div>
            <h3>Question 4: Do you think the strategy you used is clear?</h3>
            <div id="clarity" ></div>
            <h3>Question 5: Please tell us about other categories of challenges.</h3>
