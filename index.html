                <p> Welcome to the Explicit Programming Strategies research study.</p>
                <p>When you solve problems, you might not think much about how you go about solving them, and what strategies and steps you use for.
                    The reason is that you have used these approaches and strategies through many years of programming experiences and they change to daily routines.</p>
                <p>In this study, we are asking developers like you to write down the strategies you use to solve problems,
                    so that others can benefit from the strategies you have learned over time.</p>

                <h3>What is a Programming Strategy?</h3>
                <p>A strategy is a high-level plan for accomplishing a task, describing a series of steps or actions to take to accomplish a goal.
                    Strategies are a common part of everyday life, describing steps with which to find an email in an email client, cook the perfect pizza, or tie your shoes.
                    <B>Programming strategies</B>  describe how software developers do similar everyday tasks, to diagnose a performance issue or a broken control.
                    Let's take a look at a sample of strategy for installing Microsoft Office Word:

                <h3>Roboto - A language for describing strategy</h3>
                <p>To help you write down strategies in a way that other developers can use, we’ve built a language for describing strategies
                    called <b>Roboto</b>. We’ll briefly teach you how to write down a strategy in <b>Roboto</b>, walking through a few short
                    examples to illustrate its syntax. You’ll then have the opportunity to use <b>Roboto</b> to write up one of your
                    own strategies, illustrating to other developers how to tackle a common situation.</p>
            </div>

                        <h3>Roboto language constructs</h3>
                        <p>Roboto has several common features from imperative languages, including: </p>
                        <ol class="list-unstyled">
                            <li>Preconditions</li>
                            <li>Statements</li>
                            <li>Conditionals</li>
                            <li>Actions</li>
                            <li>Loops</li>
                            <li>Variables</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>To understand how to use each of these to write down a strategy in Roboto, we’ll first take a look at a complete example of a strategy and then take a look at each one by one. </p>

                <h3>A sample strategy with Roboto for merging two Github branches</h3>
                <p>The text on the right is an example Roboto strategy. It describes how to merge two branches of code, including fixing any conflicts which may arise.</p>
                <p>The first few colored lines describe what users need to know and what tools they need in order to use the strategy(Preconditions.)</p>
                <p>The strategy is started by 'Strategy' keyword, followed by the name of the strategy. In the parenthesis followed by strategy name, you can define variables that you might need to use in the strategy steps.</p>
                <p>Each line in the strategy body represents a statement. A strategy consists of a set of Statements which is represented as a sequence of steps which should be followed by a user.
                    There are multiple different statement types which will be described in next sections.</p>
                <p>Please overview the strategy steps and click the next button to learn these strategy steps piece by piece.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="preconditionsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Precondition</h3>
                <p>Preconditions express requirements about what the developer using the strategy should first know or have access to.</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Required tools and Environment:</b> Consider what resources are important to your strategy. Does it require that there be a test suite? A breakpoint debugger? A detailed log file?
                <p><b class="sideBar"> Required knowledge:</b> What level of expertise should the strategy user have? What tools, languages, or concepts should they be familiar with before using your strategy?</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Context:</b> Write your strategy for a specific context, such as a defect you debugged yesterday. Describe your application domain: embedded development in C, front end development in React, desktop Java application, etc.</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Available resources:</b> For your case, consider what resources are important to your strategy. Does it require that there be a test suite? A breakpoint debugger? A detailed log file?</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Specific Programming Knowledge:</b>  What programming languages are required to be familiar with</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Expertise level:</b>  What level of expertise the user of strategy should have</p>
            </div>
            <div id="statementsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Statement</h3>
                <p>Each statement in strategy describes what the user should do next.</p>
                <p>It could be performing specified action, gathering information, or checking some parameters, fault, or situation in the program. </p>
                <p>Statements in Robot can be one of six types:
                    <b>Action</b>,
                    <b>Definition</b>,
                    <b>Conditional</b>,
                    <b>Loop</b>,
                    <b>Return</b>,
                    <b>Call</b>
                    , which we describe in detail next.
                </p>
                <p>Additional details about each statement can be added through a comment, indicated through a # tag. These comments should be added exactly before the statement description. In the image in the right, comments are shown in blue color.</p>
                <p>Comments are not mandatory. If you think that you cannot describe all the details in a strategy statement, or you feel that not all users need detailed or basic information,
                    you can add it as a comment of extra information before each statement.</p>
                <p>Try not to repeat the same text as statement in the comments, as it will not add any further information.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="actionsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Actions</h3>
                <p>Action statements describe something that the user should do in the world.</p>
                <p>Look at the highlighted statements in the strategy. There is no predefined syntax for writing an Action statement.</p>
                <p>They are mainly in the form of an imperative sentence, which ask user to perform some action in the world, code, tool, or environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="definitionDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Definition statement always start with 'SET' keyword, followed by a <b>variable</b> definition, followed by "TO" keyword and a sentence which describe what the defined variable should be assigned to.</p>
                <p> You can see a sample of Definition statement highlighted in the GitMerge strategy</p>
                <h4>Variable</h4>
                <p>Variables make it easier for the strategy user to keep track of things, such as remembering lines of code or functions to return to. </p>
                <p>Variables may be either a primitive or a list. For instance, ‘conflicted files’ in the following example indicates a list of files which have a conflict, which subsequent statements
                    may then explicitly refer to. The helps reduce what the strategy user has to remember, making it easier for them to correctly follow the strategy.<BR></p>
                <p>For instance, <b>'conflictedFiles'</b> in the highlightes statement is a variable records a set of files that have a conflict,
                    which subsequent statements may then refer to explicitly. This helps reduce memorization burden.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="conditionalsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p> A conditional asks the strategy user to check if a condition is true in the world and then branch to different statements depending on the outcome.</p>
                <p>Conditional statements stat with "IF" keyword, followed by a query which ask user to check if a condition is true or false in the program or environment.</p>
                <p> Each branch in a Conditional statement consist of a set of statements to follow.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="loopsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Loops</h3>
                <p>Loops indicate a sequence of statements that the strategy user should potentially take more than once. </p>
                <p>In Roboto, loops take the form of a FOR EACH loop, iterating over a set of items (e.g., files, breakpoints, messages output by a tool) to take a set of actions for each.</p>
                <p> The items to loop through should be defined in the previous statements as an 'Identifier'.</p>
                <p>In this strategy, the highlighted statement shows a Loop statement which iterates through the defined variable, 'conflictedFiles', in its preceding statement.</p>
                <p>This strategy will execute the statements followed by the Foreach statement for all the 'files' being set in 'conflictedFiles'.  </p>
            </div>

            <div id="returnDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Return</h3>
                <p> Returns indicate returning a variable, Call statement, or Action statement. </p>
            </div>
            <div id="callDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Call</h3>
                <p> Call statements start with 'Do' keyword following by Sub-Strategy. </p>
                <p>They used for making nested strategies to prevent them from being disorganized, complex, and long.</p>
                <h4>Sub-Strategy</h4>
                <p>To organize long and complex strategies, strategies can be separated into sub-strategies. A sub-strategy is a strategy called by another strategy.
                    For example, strategy fixConflict is a sample of a sub-strategy which is being used and called in mergeGithubBranches strategy above. </p>

                <h3>How to write a strategy.</h3>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Define your strategy step by step.</b> Describe your strategy in the form of a sequence of statement describing steps a developer should follow. </p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Describe required tools, environments, and knowledge.</b> Make clear when your strategy can be used and who it is for by describing preconditions that should be true before a developer starts to use your strategy.</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Use comments to elaborate.</b> Each step in a strategy should be clear and concise, but you can use comments to help developers who may not fully know how to execute a step.Include your comments before each statement after # tag.</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Avoid wasted work.</b> Structure your strategy in a way that minimizes the amount of work the developer using your strategy will have to do </p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Include explicit restarts.</b> Some strategies fail; include these failure points in your strategy, guiding developers either back to the start of a strategy, or to use a different strategy.</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Include rationale.</b> At the very beginning of your strategy definition, include a one or two line comment describing the overall purpose and approach. As you describe each statement, include comments which help the user to understand why each step is being taken and how it helps realize the overall goal.</p>
                <p><b class="sideBar">Encourage externalization.</b>  When a developer will first collect some information (e.g., lines of code which reference a variable) that they will later make use of, have them write it down in the strategy. Ask them to write it down in a variable. This ensure they don’t lose anything and that they methodically consider each possibility. It also makes it easy to reference later in other parts of the strategy</p>

                    less ambiguous and clearer to users. Its should be easier to follow the Robot syntax for articulation, but if you feel it is adding some burden to your articulation, feel free to go outside of Roboto syntax.
