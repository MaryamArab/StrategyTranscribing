                <p> Welcome to the research study of Explicit Programming Strategies.</p>
                <p>Software developers solve a diverse and wide range of problems. While software engineering research often focuses on <b>tools</b> to support this problem solving,
                    the <b>strategies</b> that developers use to solve problems are at least as important as the <b>tools</b> they use. </p>
                <p>In this study, we are asking developers like you to write down the strategies you use to solve problems, so that others can benefit from them.</p>
                <p>We start with defining what we mean by Programming Strategy, then we will go through a set of tutorial steps which describe the syntax
                    of a language for describing strategies expert developers used in their everyday development life.
                    This language is called <b>Roboto</b> and  a language for writing down programming strategies.</p>
                <p>Finally, you will be asked to write down a strategy you have used in a recent programming task.</p>

                <h3>What is a Programming Strategy?</h3>

                <p>A strategy is a high-level plan for accomplishing a task, describing a series of steps or actions to take to accomplish a goal.
                    Strategies are a common part of everyday life, describing steps with which to find an email in an email client, cook the perfect pizza, or tie your shoes.
                   <B>Programming strategies</B>  describe how software developers do similar everyday tasks, like different ways to debug a defect or go about software design.
                    Some people debug by gathering lots of data about execution, then inspecting it, while others generate lots of hypotheses, testing them one by one.

                        <p>To organize long and complex strategies, strategies can be separated into sub-strategies. A sub-strategy is a strategy called by another strategy.
                            For example, strategy fixConflict is a sample of a sub-strategy which is being used and called in mergeGithubBranches strategy above. </p>
