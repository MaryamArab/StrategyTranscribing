                <p> Welcome to the Explicit Programming Strategies research study.</p>
                <p>When you solve problems, you might not think much about how you go about solving them, and what strategies and steps you use for.
                    The reason is that you have used these approaches and strategies through many years of programming experiences and they change to daily routines.</p>
                <p>In this study, we are asking developers like you to write down the strategies you use to solve problems,
                    so that others can benefit from the strategies you have learned over time.</p>

                <h3>What is a Programming Strategy?</h3>
                <p>A strategy is a high-level plan for accomplishing a task, describing a series of steps or actions to take to accomplish a goal.
                    Strategies are a common part of everyday life, describing steps with which to find an email in an email client, cook the perfect pizza, or tie your shoes.
                    <B>Programming strategies</B>  describe how software developers do similar everyday tasks, to diagnose a performance issue or a broken control.
                </p>
                <p>Let's take a look at a sample of strategy. In React, several components need to reflect the same changing data. here is a strategy for finding those part of codes that have shared
                    state and how to lift the shared state up to
                    their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action:

                            <div class="statement">1- Divide components into stateful “containers” and stateless “presenters”.</div>
                            <div class="statement">2- Pass functions (“callbacks”) that change the container state as props to children</div>
                            <div class="statement">3- If several components need to reflect the same changing data, instead of trying to sync the state between different components,
                                rely on the top-down data flow:
                                <div class="margin-oneTab">Lift state : writing more “boilerplate” code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs.

                                    <div class="margin-twoTab">lift the shared state up to their closest common ancestor.</div>
                                    <div class="margin-twoTab">Add the state to the component that needs it for rendering.</div>

                                    <div class="margin-twoTab">Now that the shared property is coming from the parent as a prop, the input has no control over it.</div>
                                    <div class="margin-twoTab">To handle controlling, make a component “controlled”; like the DOM 'input' accepts both a ‘value’ and an ‘onChange’ prop, so can the custom ‘calssInput’ accept  value and onChange props from its parent class.</div>
                                    <div class="margin-twoTab">Now, when the input wants to update its property, it calls the changed property from its parent class</div>

                <p>This strategy is not a sample of a good strategy;it does not have sufficient details which makes it hard to follow and understand what each step needs user to do. It includes many keywords which user might not be familiar with.
                    It also is not very descriptive and that makes it hard for a novice developer to understand what
                    in code they have to look at to find relevant parts. The strategy does not follow a specific syntax in steps description, so users should comprehend each sentence by themselves, which is another burden.
                </p>
                <p>In order to reduce these challenges and help experts author their strategy in a way to be more understandable and easier to follow for users, we devised a language with a
                    specific syntax for writing strartegy which will be describe in next section.</p>

                <h3>Roboto - A language for describing strategy</h3>
                <p>To help you write down strategies in a way that other developers can use, we’ve built a language for describing strategies
                    called <b>Roboto</b>. We’ll briefly teach you how to write down a strategy in <b>Roboto</b>, walking through a few short
                    examples to illustrate its syntax. You’ll then have the opportunity to use <b>Roboto</b> to write up one of your
                    own strategies, illustrating to other developers how to tackle a common situation.</p>

                <p>The text on the right is an example Roboto strategy. It describes how to merge two branches of code, including fixing any conflicts which may arise.</p>
                <p>The strategy is started by 'Strategy' keyword, followed by the name of the strategy. In the parenthesis followed by strategy name, you can define variables that you might need to use in the strategy statements steps.</p>
                <p>Each line in the strategy body represents a statement. A strategy consists of a set of Statements which is represented as a sequence of steps which should be followed by a user.
                    There are multiple different statement types which will be described in next sections.</p>
                <p>Please overview the strategy and click the next button to learn about different statements piece by piece.</p>

                <h3>Precondition</h3>
                <p>Preconditions express requirements about what the developer using the strategy should first know or have access to.</p>
                <p><b>Required tools and Environment:</b> Consider what resources are important to your strategy. Does it require that there be a test suite? A breakpoint debugger? A detailed log file?
                <p><b> Required knowledge:</b> What level of expertise should the strategy user have? What tools, languages, or concepts should they be familiar with before using your strategy?</p>
                <p><b>Context:</b> Write your strategy for a specific context, such as a defect you debugged yesterday. Describe your application domain: embedded development in C, front end development in React, desktop Java application, etc.</p>
                <p><b>Available resources:</b> For your case, consider what resources are important to your strategy. Does it require that there be a test suite? A breakpoint debugger? A detailed log file?</p>
                <p><b>Specific Programming Knowledge:</b>  What programming languages are required to be familiar with</p>
                <p><b>Expertise level:</b>  What level of expertise the user of strategy should have</p>
            </div>
            <div id="statementsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Statement</h3>
                <p>Each statement in strategy describes what the user should do next.</p>
                <p>It could be performing specified action, gathering information, or checking some parameters, fault, or situation in the program. </p>
                <p>Statements in Robot can be one of six types:
                    <b>Action</b>,
                    <b>Definition</b>,
                    <b>Conditional</b>,
                    <b>Loop</b>,
                    <b>Return</b>,
                    <b>Call</b>
                    , which we describe in detail next.
                </p>
                <p>Additional details about each statement can be added through a comment, indicated through a # tag. These comments should be added exactly before the statement description. In the image in the right, comments are shown in blue color.</p>
                <p>Comments are not mandatory. If you think that you cannot describe all the details in a strategy statement, or you feel that not all users need detailed or basic information,
                    you can add it as a comment of extra information before each statement.</p>
                <p>Try not to repeat the same text as statement in the comments, as it will not add any further information.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="actionsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Actions</h3>
                <p>Action statements describe something that the user should do in the world.</p>
                <p>Look at the highlighted statements in the strategy. There is no predefined syntax for writing an Action statement.</p>
                <p>They are mainly in the form of an imperative sentence, which ask user to perform some action in the world, code, tool, or environment.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="definitionDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Definition statement always start with 'SET' keyword, followed by a <b>variable</b> definition, followed by "TO" keyword and a sentence which describe what the defined variable should be assigned to.</p>
                <p> You can see a sample of Definition statement highlighted in the GitMerge strategy</p>
                <h4>Variable</h4>
                <p>Variables make it easier for the strategy user to keep track of things, such as remembering lines of code or functions to return to. </p>
                <p>Variables may be either a primitive or a list. For instance, ‘conflicted files’ in the following example indicates a list of files which have a conflict, which subsequent statements
                    may then explicitly refer to. The helps reduce what the strategy user has to remember, making it easier for them to correctly follow the strategy.<BR></p>
                <p>For instance, <b>'conflictedFiles'</b> in the highlightes statement is a variable records a set of files that have a conflict,
                    which subsequent statements may then refer to explicitly. This helps reduce memorization burden.</p>

            </div>
            <div id="conditionalsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Conditionals</h3>
                <p> A conditional asks the strategy user to check if a condition is true in the world and then branch to different statements depending on the outcome.</p>
                <p>Conditional statements stat with "IF" keyword, followed by a query which ask user to check if a condition is true or false in the program or environment.</p>
                <p> Each branch in a Conditional statement consist of a set of statements to follow.</p>

            </div>

            <div id="loopsDescriptionDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Loops</h3>
                <p>Loops indicate a sequence of statements that the strategy user should potentially take more than once. </p>
                <p>In Roboto, loops take the form of a FOR EACH loop, iterating over a set of items (e.g., files, breakpoints, messages output by a tool) to take a set of actions for each.</p>
                <p> The items to loop through should be defined in the previous statements as an 'Identifier'.</p>
                <p>In this strategy, the highlighted statement shows a Loop statement which iterates through the defined variable, 'conflictedFiles', in its preceding statement.</p>
                <p>This strategy will execute the statements followed by the Foreach statement for all the 'files' being set in 'conflictedFiles'.  </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Return</h3>
                <p> Returns indicate returning a variable, Call statement, or Action statement. </p>

            <div id="callDiv" style="display:none;">
                <h3>Call</h3>
                <p> Call statements start with 'Do' keyword following by Sub-Strategy. </p>
                <p>They are used for making nested strategies to prevent them from being disorganized, complex, and long.</p>
                <h4>Sub-Strategy</h4>
                <p>To organize long and complex strategies, strategies can be separated into sub-strategies. A sub-strategy is a strategy called by another strategy.
                    For example, strategy fixConflict is a sample of a sub-strategy which is being used and called in mergeGithubBranches strategy above. </p>

                <h3>How to write a strategy.</h3>
                <p><b>Define your strategy step by step.</b> Describe your strategy in the form of a sequence of statement describing steps a developer should follow. </p>
                <p><b>Describe required tools, environments, and knowledge.</b> Make clear when your strategy can be used and who it is for by describing preconditions that should be true before a developer starts to use your strategy.</p>
                <p><b>Use comments to elaborate.</b> Each step in a strategy should be clear and concise, but you can use comments to help developers who may not fully know how to execute a step.Include your comments before each statement after # tag.</p>
                <p><b>Avoid wasted work.</b> Structure your strategy in a way that minimizes the amount of work the developer using your strategy will have to do </p>
                <p><b>Include explicit restarts.</b> Some strategies fail; include these failure points in your strategy, guiding developers either back to the start of a strategy, or to use a different strategy.</p>
                <p><b>Include rationale.</b> At the very beginning of your strategy definition, include a one or two line comment describing the overall purpose and approach. As you describe each statement, include comments which help the user to understand why each step is being taken and how it helps realize the overall goal.</p>
                <p><b>Encourage externalization.</b>  When a developer will first collect some information (e.g., lines of code which reference a variable) that they will later make use of, have them write it down in the strategy. Ask them to write it down in a variable. This ensure they don’t lose anything and that they methodically consider each possibility. It also makes it easy to reference later in other parts of the strategy</p>

                <h3>It’s now time to write up one of your own strategies. Let's start writing one.</h3>
                <P>You should have received a task in our last email. Please go read this task description again now. </P>
                <p>Think about the task described. Can you remember a similar challenge you experienced in your own work? What did you do? Think about the steps you took, the information you looked for, the tools you used to take these steps, and how this information ultimately helped you to make progress.</p>
                <p>Now imagine a developer who just stopped by your office who now has to do this very same task. What advice can you give them?</p>
                <p>Describe the best strategy you can offer the developer, including as much detail as you think necessary for a developer to understand how to work in the way you just did.</p>
                <p>As you’re writing down your strategy, remembering the following guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Define your strategy step by step.</li>
                    <li>Describe required tools, environments, and knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Use comments to elaborate.</li>
                    <li>Avoid wasted work. </li>
                    <li>Include explicit restarts.</li>
                    <li>Include rationale</li>
                    <li>Encourage externalization</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="color: darkred;">What you have learned about Roboto is just for the sake of being precise in articulating strategy and helping to make strategies
                    less ambiguous and clearer to users. Its should be easier to follow the Robot syntax for articulation, but if you feel it is adding some burden to your articulation, feel free to go outside of Roboto syntax.
                    <b>To make it clear, we aren’t looking for difficulties with Roboto syntax.</b></p>

            <h3>Task: Chrome Performance Profiler Task</h3>
            <p>Sophisticated web applications can have performance problems like any website.
                To make performance profiling easier, Chrome  has introduced a Chrome DevTools: JavaScript CPU Profiling, which collects timing information about each component to be rendered, then visualizes data about rendering so that developers can identify sources of inefficiency in rendering.</p>

            <p>There's just one problem: using the Chrome Profiler, just like using any profiler, requires good *strategies* to be useful. For example, a naive profiling strategy might be:</p>

           <ul>
               <li style="font-weight: normal!important;">Load the web application</li>
               <li style="font-weight: normal!important;">Start recording performance with the profiler</li>
               <li style="font-weight: normal!important;">Look at the flame chart, which visualizes how long various components took to render during the recording</li>
               <li style="font-weight: normal!important;">Identify the component taking the most time to render</li>
               <li style="font-weight: normal!important;">Optimize the slow component</li>
           </ul>

            <p>This isn't a particularly effective profiling strategy because it's not very intentional about what was recorded, whether that recording is representative of a performance problem, and whether enough data is gathered to actually diagnose the problem. It also ignores which parts of the application you can actually modify.</p>

            <p>Your task is to write a better profiling strategy than the one above, which other developers can use to learn how to effectively profile any web application. Consider the following in the strategy you write:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What steps should a developer follow to accurately identify slow components?</li>
                <li>How should they diagnose why those components are slow?</li>
                <li>What data should they look at?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Include enough detail that someone with experience with web development and JavaScript, but no experience profiling the performance of a program, could successfully optimize a web-based application.</p>
