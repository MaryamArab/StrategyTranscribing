                <p> Welcome to the Explicit Programming Strategies research study.</p>
                <p>Software developers solve a diverse and wide range of problems. While software engineering research often focuses on <b>tools</b> to support this problem solving,
                    the <b>strategies</b> that developers use to solve problems are at least as important as the <b>tools</b> they use. </p>
                <p>In this study, we are asking developers like you to write down the strategies you use to solve problems,
                    so that others can benefit from the strategies you have learned over time.</p>
                <p>To help you write down strategies in a way that other developers can use, we’ve built a language for describing strategies
                    called <b>Roboto</b>. We’ll briefly teach you how to write down a strategy in <b>Roboto</b>, walking through a few short
                    examples to illustrate its syntax. You’ll then have the opportunity to use <b>Roboto</b> to write up one of your
                    own strategies, illustrating to other developers how to tackle a common situation.</p>

                <h3>What is a Programming Strategy?</h3>

                <p>A strategy is a high-level plan for accomplishing a task, describing a series of steps or actions to take to accomplish a goal.
                    Strategies are a common part of everyday life, describing steps with which to find an email in an email client, cook the perfect pizza, or tie your shoes.
                   <B>Programming strategies</B>  describe how software developers do similar everyday tasks, to diagnose a performance issue or a broken control.

                        <p>Roboto has several common features from imperative languages, including: </p>

                        <p>To understand how to use each of these to write down a strategy in Roboto, we’ll first take a look at a complete example of a strategy and then take a look at each one by one. </p>

                        <p>In Roboto, loops take the form of a FOR EACH loop, iterating over a set of items (e.g., files, breakpoints, messages output by a tool) to take a set of actions for each.</p>

                        <h3>Variable</h3>
                        <p>
                            Variables make it easier for the strategy user to keep track of things, such as remembering lines of code or functions to return to. </p>
                        <p>Variables may be either a primitive or a list. For instance, ‘conflicted files’ in the following example indicates a list of files which have a conflict, which subsequent statements
                            may then explicitly refer to. The helps reduce what the strategy user has to remember, making it easier for them to correctly follow the strategy.<BR>

                        <p>
                            For instance, <b>'conflictedFiles'</b> in the following is a variable records a set of files that have a conflict, which subsequent statements may then refer to explicitly. This helps reduce memorization burden.

                        <p>To organize long and complex strategies, strategies can be separated into sub-strategies. A sub-strategy is a strategy called by another strategy.
                            For example, strategy fixConflict is a sample of a sub-strategy which is being used and called in mergeGithubBranches strategy above. </p>

                        <h3>How to write a strategy.</h3>

                    <p><b class="sideBar">Describe required tools, environments, and knowledge. </b>Make clear when your strategy can be used and who it is for by describing preconditions that should be true before a developer starts to use your strategy.</p>
                    <BR>
                    <p><b class="sideBar">Use comments to elaborate. </b> Each step in a strategy should be clear and concise, but you can use comments to help developers who may not fully know how to execute a step.Include your comments before each statement after # tag.</p>
                    <BR>
                    <p><b class="sideBar">Avoid wasted work. </b>Structure your strategy in a way that minimizes the amount of work the developer using your strategy will have to do </p>
                    <BR>
                    <p><b class="sideBar">Include explicit restarts.</b> Some strategies fail; include these failure points in your strategy, guiding developers either back to the start of a strategy, or to use a different strategy.</p>
                    <BR>
                    <p><b class="sideBar">Include rationale.</b>At the very beginning of your strategy definition, include a one or two line comment describing the overall purpose and approach. As you describe each statement, include comments which help the user to understand why each step is being taken and how it helps realize the overall goal.</p>
                    <BR>
                    <p><b class="sideBar">Encourage externalization.</b>  When a developer will first collect some information (e.g., lines of code which reference a variable) that they will later make use of, have them write it down in the strategy. Ask them to write it down in a variable. This ensure they don’t lose anything and that they methodically consider each possibility. It also makes it easy to reference later in other parts of the strategy</p>
